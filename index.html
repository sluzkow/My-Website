                          <h3>Background</h3>
                            <p>My background in environmental risk management in the private sector was driven by a desire for change and continuous improvement. Accomplishments included policy development, accompanied by training presentations, and association leadership. Dovetailing with my interest in photography, front end development allows me to pursue a creative path that pairs with the analytics required for web development. This spurred my career in the front line of web development. </p>

                          <h3>The Web </h3>
                            <p>Web development and design skills include HTML5, CSS, Visual Design, Java Script, UX, UI, Word Press, PHP, Photoshop, Git, GitHub, and Ruby on Rails. With this background I can take a designer's product, or create a dewsign for you, and convert it into a web site which provides an internal and external user experience and interface that reflects both your corporate brand and personality. Whether by phone, tablet of computer, your site will be responsive to each device. </p>

                       <h3> For Your Company </h3>
                         <p>What is projected on the web reflects the brand, and perosnality of a business. In addition, it must provide a user experience and interface that culminates in a response that benefits that business entity. To meet your needs I team with you to insure  the development process is conducted efficiently and that there is communication during the process. We will work on a ceonceptual approach together so that we have a mutual understanding of the desired user experience and interface. </p>
